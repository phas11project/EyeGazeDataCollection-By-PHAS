# Eye Gaze Data Collection Tool BY PHAS GROUP 11

## **Project Title and Description**

**Eye Gaze Data Collection Tool** is a web-based platform designed for capturing and labeling eye gaze directions (left, right, center, blink, stop) using real-time webcam integration. The tool supports metadata collection, including lighting conditions and glasses usage, to improve the quality of training data for deep learning models. This makes it ideal for creating advanced gaze-based applications, such as wheelchair control, that require accurate and real-time gaze tracking.

## **Features**

- **Real-Time Webcam Integration**: Capture eye gaze directions in real-time through a webcam.
- **Automatic Labeling**: Eye gaze data is automatically captured and saved with the correct labels and timestamps for easy organization.
- **Metadata Collection**: Supports capturing lighting conditions (good, poor, sunlight) and glasses usage to improve training data quality.
- **Deep Learning Compatibility**: Data is structured to enhance training for machine learning models, enabling advanced gaze recognition applications.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for different screen sizes and devices, making it accessible across platforms.
